        <p><strong>LOG LINE:</strong></p>
        <p>A show about relationships, friendships, hardships...any ships, really.</p>

        <p><strong>THE PLOT:</strong></p>
        <p>After his Mom passes away, Ethan (Mikiech Nichols) discovers he's inherited her house.
        However, the house's in debt & in danger of being foreclosed if he doesn't come up with some fast cash.
        <p>He quickly enlists the help of his old friend Rob (Devin Badoo), an aspring actor returning
        from Hollywood with his tail between his legs after finding little success there.</p>
        <p>After the reunited friends post a rambling, drunken craigslist ad
        they're stuck with the only applicants weird enough to answer it:
        an eccentric performance artist named Alice (Sierra McKenzie)
        who shows up at 5am, suitcases in hand, ready to move in
        and a mysterious stranger in a suit named Greg (Eric Sanders)
        who promptly weirds them all out with his epic vagueness & wads of cash.</p>
        <p><strong>BEHIND THE SCENES:</strong></p>
        <p>Creator Jason Ryan grew up worshipping at the altar of The Sitcom and spent most of
        his youth watching worn out tapes of "Seinfeld", "Friends", "Cheers" and any
        show he could figure out how to program his VCR to record.</p>
        <p>One day he decided he was sick of sitting on the sidelines and drafted a couple of creative friends,
        Bobby Farrington, Eric Sanders and Colin Thiel, to help write and produce his own ensemble sitcom.
        "Real Adult Feelings", loosely based on an old podcast spearheaded by Ryan and Farrington,
        was then birthed into the world. It started out rocky, with barely working borrowed
        equipment and a crew of 2 (literally) but has developed into a full fledged TV production, albeit one
        exclusively on the internet. The show is full length, meaning each episode is 20+ minutes typically.</p>
